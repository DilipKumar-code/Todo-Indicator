TODO-INDICATOR
==============

An Ubuntu app indicator for todo.txt-style todo lists. More info about todo.txt
here: http://todotxt.com/


REQUIREMENTS
------------
* Python
* Pyinotify
* Some kinda Ubuntu app indicator-compatible junk


HOW DO I USE IT?
----------------
Just run it, passing the name of your todo.txt file as an argument, e.g.:

    $ ./todo-indicator.py ~/todo.txt

Click the indicator icon to check out your list of must-do-ables. If you finish
one of your tasks, give yourself a pat on the back and click it! It'll be
marked "done."


BUT I WANT MORE COMPLEX FUNCTIONALITY!
--------------------------------------
You mean you want to change priorities, add "contexts" and "projects," and so
on? Well, the best way to do that isn't with some silly little program -- it's
with your trusty text editor! That's the whole beauty of the todo.txt system.

Simply click the "Edit todo.txt" menu item and your todo list will pop open in
your text editor of choice. (Or your OS's text editor of choice, at least -- it
uses xdg-open.) Once you've made your changes and saved the file, you should
automatically see your updates reflected in todo-indicator. (Thanks, inotify!)
If for some reason the indicator doesn't update properly, try clicking the
"Refresh" menu item to hard refresh everything.


WHAT ELSE?
----------
That's all! Enjoy.
